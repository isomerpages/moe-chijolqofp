### Fusion Dance

#### Aims

To inculcate in each member an appreciation for dance and to nurture the creativity in each of them through exposing them to Chinese dance and other dances. This will provide each member the opportunity to develop and grow according to her talent and ability.

#### What do we do

Fusion Dance inculcates in the members an appreciation for dance. It helps them to develop the ability to express themselves through movement as they hone their skills and learn the different techniques in dancing. It also serves as a platform for the members to showcase their talent in school performances and SYF competitions.

During practices, professional instructors are engaged to train members in a repertoire of dances such as Chinese dance as well as modern and contemporary dance. Through these practices, performances and competitions, members inculcate the virtues of perseverance, unity, commitment and self-discipline.

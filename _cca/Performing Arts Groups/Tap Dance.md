### Tap Dance

#### Aims

To nurture the creativity and potential in all members through tap dancing and provide opportunities for every tap dancer to develop and grow according to her talent and ability through both internal and external performances.

#### What do we do

Weekly CCA sessions are conducted for our members. Junior members with no dance background will learn basic dance steps. Intermediate and advanced dance steps will be introduced when our members proceed to the next level. All members are given the opportunities to perform at various school concerts as well as community projects. Selected senior members will be trained to take part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) every two years.Â   
  

Dance workshops will also be organised once very semester for our members to gain more exposure through learning other forms of dance. Through tap dancing, the tap dancers will develop a good sense of rhythm and timing, and learn to express themselves through the freedom of movement to music.

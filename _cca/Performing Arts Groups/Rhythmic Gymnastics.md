### Rhythmic Gymnastics

#### Aim

Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport in which gymnasts perform on a floor with an apparatus: hoop, ball, clubs, ribbon or rope. In addition to the physical requirement of the sport, we aim to nurture in our young athletes the virtues of discipline, respect and teamwork.

#### What do we do

Primary 3 & 4 Team: 

As the pioneer batch of gymnasts, we will be focusing on the basic apparatus handling/manipulations and learning of new skills.

Physical training also includes conditioning for strength and stamina and stretching exercises for flexibility.  

Trainings will also emphasize on character building and team-bonding elements through positive reinforcement of good practices, building resilience and perseverance and opportunities for leadership.

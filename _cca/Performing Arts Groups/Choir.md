#### What do we do

The Choir of CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace has been one of the pioneering CCAs since the school was established in 1955. These young choristers come together with a strong passion and love for singing. They train hard under the astute tutelage of their instructor, Ms Angila Tan, who continuously set higher standards for them as they learn and perform songs of different languages and cultures, widening their repertoire and executing deeper and more impactful melodies to the audience.   

Students who enjoy singing are encouraged to take up this popular CCA. Choir members are taught music theory, musicianship and sight-singing skills as well as vocal techniques which are conducted in a fun and engaging manner. They are also introduced to a wide repertoire of songs and various performing art forms.

<p><strong>What We Do</strong>
</p>
<p>Guided by the mission of our Founder, Blessed Nicolas Barré, Mother Mathilde,
and the Infant Jesus Sisters to serve with love and compassion—especially
those who are disadvantaged — Little L.I.G.H.T.S. (Love In Giving Hope
To Someone) is a community service initiative. In this CCA, students begin
their journey by discovering the joy of giving through small yet thoughtful
acts of kindness within their school community and gradually deepen their
empathy and teamwork through collaborative projects such as eco-friendly
initiatives and peer support that encourage care, respect, and responsibility.
As they mature, students take greater ownership of service by planning
and leading initiatives that address real community needs, demonstrating
love, compassion, initiative, and responsibility. Through these experiences,
they learn that leadership is rooted not in position but in service to
others.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they grow into confident and caring leaders who inspire those
around them by living out the CHIJ values of Truth, Justice, Freedom, and
Love in both word and action—becoming beacons of light who contribute meaningfully
to their school, community, and beyond.</p>

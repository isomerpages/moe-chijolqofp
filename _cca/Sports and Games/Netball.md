### Netball

#### Aims 

Netball is a sport that trains agility, speed and endurance. Besides the physical requirements of the game, we hope to nurture mental strength, leadership and team spirit in the girls. It is our vision to develop in our players a love for the game and life skills that will live in them.


#### What do we do

KidzNet Team (Primary 3):

A begginer’s netball programme is developed for our Primary 3 players. As this is an exploratory stage of learning the game, the emphasis is on fun, active participation and the development of basic netball skills.

Bloomers Team (Primary 4):

An intermediate netball programme is developed for our Primary 4 players. Players will continue to hone their ball skills and techniques, with more emphasis on game concepts through modified games with shorter game play, shorter goal posts and rotational positions. In preparation for selection for the school team, players also take part in netball carnivals which provides them valuable exposure in competitive play and also enhance their chemistry as a team. From Primary 4 onwards, players also can look forward to the S.T.A.R.R Athletes Camp and Living C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S programme, which further develop in them, the necessary knowledge, skills and attitude required to excel in sports and also forge stronger friendships among them.

Stompers Team: Junior (Primary 5) and Senior (Primary 6):

An advanced netball programme is developed for Primary 5 and 6 players who have shown the skills and aptitude to represent the school in the National School Games in both the Junior and Senior Divisions. In preparation for the competitions, players go through more intensive and all-rounded training sessions to prepare them physically and mentally. At this stage, players work towards excelling in terms of speed, agility and accuracy. These tournaments give them valuable exposure in competitive play and help them develop the virtues of diligence, commitment and good sportsmanship. There are also leadership opportunities for potential players to lead and serve.

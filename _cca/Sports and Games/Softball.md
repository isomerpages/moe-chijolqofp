### Softball

#### Aims

In Softball, we believe that “Every player’s a potential, Every player’s a part of the game and Every player matters.” Through the CCA, we hope to develop basic sports skills and competencies, promote quick and intelligent decision making as an individual as well as a team player and to develop good sportsmanship and resilience in the players. 

#### What do we do

Weekly training includes not only development in the skills required for the game of softball but also a strength and conditioning component to maintain the fitness level of all students. Our students not only learn to play the game, they are also training their mind and body to improve their abilities.  

Annually, the school selects a maximum of 15 to 18 players to participate in the National Inter-Primary Schools Softball Games for both Senior and Junior Division. We have a team of qualified coaches who play an extremely important role in the training program of the Softball CCA. The teachers and coaches work hand in hand in providing students with the best possible experience from their sports participation.

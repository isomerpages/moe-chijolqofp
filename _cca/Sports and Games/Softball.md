<h3>Softball</h3>
<h4>Aims</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop strong sporting skills and competencies in the players;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To promote quick and intelligent decision making as an individual as well
as a team player; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop good sportsmanship, teamwork and resilience in the players.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What We Do</h4>
<p>During the weekly training sessions, the players hone their skills such
as throwing, catching, fielding, pitching, batting and base-running through
fun drills and games. There is also a strength and conditioning component
designed in the programme to train their mind and body to improve their
physical and mental toughness abilities.</p>
<p>In addition to developing softball skills and competencies, the CCA also
aims to impart the virtues of sportsmanship, teamwork, resilience and leadership
in our players. In preparation for selection for the school team, our softball
players are given opportunities to hone their skills through friendly matches
and competitions.</p>
<p>Every year, the school selects about 15 to 18 players to participate in
the National School Games Softball Championship for both Junior and Senior
Divisions. Players also can look forward to the annual S.T.A.R.R Athletes
Camp and Living C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S programme, which further develop in them,
the necessary knowledge, skills and attitude required to excel in sports
and also forge stronger friendships among them. There are also leadership
opportunities for potential players to lead the team as Captain and Vice-captain.</p>

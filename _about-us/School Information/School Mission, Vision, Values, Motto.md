CHIJ OLQP’s character development programme, Character Lives In My Behaviour (CLIMB) aims to develop moral and performance character in our students. CLIMB adopts The Virtues ProjectTM in delivering our character education to awaken the virtues which exist within every child and help them to act on the best within them, in order to achieve Truth, Justice, Freedom and Love.  

#### Our Motto

##### Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty

To be Simple in Virtue is to go to God in full confidence and love. To be Steadfast in Duty means an awareness of our duty to be of service to others. This duty of giving of self, demands energy because it presents itself daily and hourly. Only when one puts self and petty interests aside, can this steadfastness in duty be fully achieved. This service begins in us and its limits are at the ends of the earth.

#### Mother Tongue Fortnight 2021

The Mother Tongue Language Fortnight 2021 was held from 6 July to 16 July.  The theme for this year's MTL Fortnight is ‘_Our Heritage, Our Culture’_.  P1 to P6 students were involved in hands-on activities and they also got to know more about the different ethnic cultures through a series of fun-filled activities. Our school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on the last day of MTL fortnight as well.

<p>The Art framework in CHIJ OLQP aims to meet the needs of our students
beyond academic achievement, contributing to the social, emotional and
holistic development through art and craft. In fostering the artistic development
of students, our school has a structured 3-tier approach in promoting a
wide variety of artistic activities, appreciation and artistic excellence
among our students, anchored on the school values of Truth, Justice, Freedom
and Love.</p>
<p>Tier 1: Artistic Literacy for All</p>
<p>Our schoolâ€™s Art programme is a primary contributor to building a strong
foundation for the acquisition of fundamental artistic skills and development
of artistic awareness in students. During Art lessons, we use a variety
of teaching strategies to bring about the joy of learning art in its many
creative forms. We want our students to stay true to themselves as they
use this means to express themselves and at the same time develop artistic
competence and confidence.</p>
<p>Tier 2: Artistic Encounter and Appreciation</p>
<p>With a strong foundation in artistic literacy acquired in Tier 1, our
students can look forward to pursuing their interests through school and
level wide programmes that focus on experiencing art making through various
mediums. Notable highlights include our annual Think! Contemporary Programme,
a museum-based learning experience in collaboration with the Singapore
Art Museum, which brings art education to life beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Tier 3: Artistic Excellence</p>
<p>Under Tier 3, students who are artistically talented can pursue a more
advanced level through our Visual Arts CCA Programme as well as other platforms
to showcase their talents. Students will be progressively developed to
excel and provided with opportunities to participate in competitions and
showcases, such as the biennial SYF Art Exhibition and the termly Arts
Alive! exhibitions. Additionally, partnerships with People's Association
and Singapore Art Museum have created further opportunities to display
our students' artworks. These programmes are designed to celebrate and
nurture our students' artistic talent, creativity, and unique visual perspectives.
Under this tier, they lead by example and serve as an inspiration to all.</p>

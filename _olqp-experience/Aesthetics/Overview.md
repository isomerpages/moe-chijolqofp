### Aesthetics

CHIJ OLQP Arts Education aims to develop all OLQP girls to be confident advocates of the Arts and to demonstrate skills in both Visual and Performing Arts. Our art and music programmes nurture our girls to reach their creative potential and become:

  

*   _Enthusiastic Learners_ \- learners who develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes to pursue and appreciate the arts
*   _Humble Leaders_ \- leaders who value and contribute to the appreciation of the arts for self, others and the environment
*   _Gracious Ladies_ \- ladies who acquire self-confidence, poise and elegance through the aesthetic programmes and emerge balanced and well-rounded individuals.

<p>The Music framework in CHIJ OLQP aims to meet the needs of our students
beyond academic achievement, contributing to the social, emotional and
holistic development through music. In fostering the musical development
of students, our school has a structured 3-tier approach in promoting a
wide variety of musical activities, appreciation and musical excellence
among our students anchored on the school values of Truth, Justice, Freedom
and Love.</p>
<p>Tier 1: Musical Literacy for All</p>
<p>Our school’s Music programme is a primary contributor to building a strong
foundation for the acquisition of fundamental musical skills and development
of musical awareness and culture in students. In our Music lessons, we
want our students to experience music and movement through creative expressions
as well as improvisation. These skills and experiences reinforce the learning
of 21st Century Competencies skills to better prepare them to be future
ready.</p>
<p>Tier 2 : Musical Encounter and Appreciation</p>
<p>Building on the solid foundation in musical literacy established at Tier
1, we further nurture student involvement and interest in music through
school-wide programmes and level-wide instrumental studies. Key highlights
include Twinkly Handbells, Recorder Karate, Aloha Ukulele, and Digital
Music. We work closely with relevant partners from the National Arts Council
to bring music education beyond classroom teaching. These experiences not
only widen our students’ musical knowledge and perspective but also promote
a greater joy and passion in their musical learning journey.</p>
<p>Tier 3: Musical Excellence</p>
<p>At Tier 3, students pursue music at a more advanced level through our
Performing Arts CCA Programme based on their interest and aptitude. They
are progressively developed to excel in their skills and knowledge, build
confidence and teamwork and deepen their overall musicking experience.
Platforms such as our ‘Fantastic Fridays’ Pre-assembly programme, Arts
in Us Recess Performances and various internal and external events provide
opportunities for our students to showcase their talents through performances
and showmanship. These students will continue to spread the joy of learning
and inspire others with their love for music.</p>

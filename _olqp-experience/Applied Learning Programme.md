<h3>Applied Learning Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) at CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace</strong>
</p>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) at CHIJ OLQP offers students authentic
and hands-on learning experiences that integrate interdisciplinary knowledge
and develop critical metacognitive skills. Through initiatives like the
STEM in Sustainability programme and Makerspace, students build essential
competencies in computational, inventive, and critical thinking.</p>
<p>STEM in Sustainability</p>
<p>Aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Singapore’s
Green Plan,&nbsp;<em>STEM in Sustainability</em>&nbsp;engages Primary 3,
4 and 6 students in solving real-world challenges. By applying programming
concepts through tools like Micro:bit, students explore innovative solutions
while gaining practical skills.</p>
<p><strong>Programme Highlights:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Primary 3: STEM in Food Sustainability</strong>
<br>Primary 3 students explore food sustainability through hands-on STEM learning
experiences. They design and build a humidity sensor and a self-watering
planter to optimise plant growth, developing creative problem-solving and
design-thinking skills.</p>
<p>Aligned with the Science topic <em>Life Cycle of Plants</em>, students
participate in the Young Farmers’ Programme, where they grow vegetables
in the school’s garden plots. Through planting and harvesting kangkong,
they gain first-hand experience in sustainable food production and deepen
their understanding of Singapore’s <em>30 by 30</em> food resilience plan.</p>
<p>To further extend their learning on sustainability, students also explore
ways to reduce food waste by creating their own citrus enzyme cleaners
using orange peels, reinforcing the importance of resourcefulness and environmental
responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 4 STEM Programme: Energy Sustainability</strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary 4 STEM Programme focuses on developing students’ understanding
of energy sustainability, with an emphasis on Singapore’s energy challenges
and the need for responsible energy use. Students apply their knowledge
of energy concepts to identify and address real-world energy sustainability
issues within the school context.</p>
<p>Using the Design Thinking framework and basic coding skills, students
collaborate to design and create interactive digital games that promote
energy-saving behaviours. Through this process, students develop critical,
adaptive, and inventive thinking skills<u>, </u>strengthen their digital
literacy, and learn to communicate their ideas confidently by sharing and
showcasing their creations with peers.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Primary 6 STEM Programme: Tackling Climate Change</strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary 6 STEM Programme focuses on climate action, aligned with the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action). Students
deepen their understanding of pressing climate issues such as rising global
temperatures, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss, examined from
both Singapore and global perspectives.</p>
<p>Through the Design Thinking framework, students conceptualise and develop
innovative physical and/or digital prototypes that propose practical and
impactful solutions to mitigate climate challenges. The programme emphasises
critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative problem-solving, empowering
students to apply STEM knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Makerspace@OLQP</strong>
</p>
<p>Maker Education at CHIJ OLQP provides students with opportunities to collaborate
and solve problems through hands-on exploration and free play. Makerspace@OLQP
offers a dedicated learning space where students can engage in the design
thinking process, brainstorming ideas, creating prototypes, and testing
their solutions during recess. These exciting activities spark the joy
of learning and inspire students to think critically and creatively to
solve problems in innovative ways.</p>

<p>Primary 3 and Primary 6 students explored the exciting world of 3D pen
design, applying their newly acquired skills to create a variety of three-dimensional
forms. Primary 3 students designed and crafted shapes to decorate table
organisers made from recycled materials, integrating creativity with sustainability.
In celebration of National Day, Primary 6 students used 3D pens to create
uniquely Singaporean icons, expressing national identity through hands-on
digital making and design.</p>

<p>Primary 4 and Primary 5 students engaged in hands-on making activities
using Strawbees. Primary 4 students designed and constructed a shoemerang
using cardboard and Strawbees, applying their understanding of forces and
motion. Primary 5 students worked in teams to design and build a thrilling
roller coaster, exploring structure, stability, and energy transfer. Through
these collaborative challenges, students developed creativity, critical
thinking, and teamwork skills.</p>

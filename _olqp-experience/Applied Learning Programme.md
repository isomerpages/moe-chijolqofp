<h3>Applied Learning Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) at CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace</strong>
</p>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) at CHIJ OLQP offers students authentic
and hands-on learning experiences that integrate interdisciplinary knowledge
and develop critical metacognitive skills. Through initiatives like the
STEM in Sustainability programme and Makerspace, students build essential
competencies in computational, inventive, and critical thinking.</p>
<h4>STEM in Sustainability (Coding Curriculum)</h4>
<p>Primary 3 to 6 students learn basic programming concepts through the use
of programming software such as Scratch, Makey Makey and CoderZ. They apply
the codes learnt to devise coding-based solutions to solve real world problems.
Some examples of projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating a humidity sensor and simple self-watering planter to optimise
plant growth. In this project, our students learn to find innovative ways
to solve food sustainability problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building a prototype of a street lamp that only lights up the path and
does not disturb the wildlife living in proximity. To achieve this, our
students learn to use paper coding to code for sustainable use of lighting
by solar panels.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Maker Education in CHIJ OLQP creates opportunities for our students to
come together and solve problems through free play. Makerspace@OLQP provides
a learning space for our students ideate, tinker with digital or physical
fabrication tools to construct objects during their free time at recess.
The exciting activities promote joy of learning and our students are encouraged
to think out of the box to solve problems creatively.</p>

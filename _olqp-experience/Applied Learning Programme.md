</p>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) at CHIJ OLQP offers students authentic
and hands-on learning experiences that integrate interdisciplinary knowledge
and develop critical metacognitive skills. Through initiatives like the
STEM in Sustainability programme and Makerspace, students build essential
competencies in computational, inventive, and critical thinking.</p>
<h4>STEM in Sustainability</h4>
<p>Aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Singaporeâ€™s
Green Plan, <em>STEM in Sustainability</em> engages Primary 3 to 5 students
in solving real-world challenges. By applying programming concepts through
tools like Micro:bit, students explore innovative solutions while gaining
practical skills.</p>

<p>Maker Education in CHIJ OLQP creates opportunities for our students to
come together and solve problems through free play. Makerspace@OLQP provides
a learning space for our students ideate, tinker with digital or physical
fabrication tools to construct objects during their free time at recess.
The exciting activities promote joy of learning and our students are encouraged
to think out of the box to solve problems creatively.</p>

<h3>Learn for Life Programme</h3>
<p><strong>C</strong>haracter&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>ives&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>n&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>y&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>ehaviour
(<strong>CLIMB</strong>) is the school’s Learn for Life Programme (LLP).
CLIMB aims to impart values and 21st Century Competencies in our students
by equipping them with the necessary knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours
for them to succeed in school and in life.</p>
<p>The CLIMB Programme is grounded in values and guided by the principle
of being inclusive in the delivery of the programmes in order to achieve
the CHIJ OLQP desired student outcomes. It encompasses the Virtues Project,
Lifeskills/Catechism Lessons, Values-in-Action (VIA) and Student Leadership.
These are aligned to the school’s vision of developing each student to
be an ‘Enthusiastic Learner, Humble Leader and Gracious Lady’. It seeks
to achieve the following:</p>
<p>Bring out the best in every child by encouraging her to understand, value
and demonstrate virtues in her everyday life through the Virtues Project
and Lifeskills/Catechism;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide experiential learning opportunities for values and student leadership
skills to be put into action; and
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide avenues for students to love, lead and serve for the well-being
of their peers, the larger student population and the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We bring together the various elements of the CLIMB Programme in the implementation
of the LLP. The Virtues Project and Lifeskills/Catechism lessons serve
as teaching platforms while the VIA and Student Leadership opportunities
give our students space and time to translate their learning into actions.</p>

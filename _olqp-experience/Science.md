<h3>Science</h3>
<p>At CHIJ OLQP, our Science lessons are designed to spark curiosity and
deepen understanding through an Inquiry-based approach. By connecting scientific
concepts to real-world phenomena, students are encouraged to ask meaningful
questions like "HOW?" and "WHY?" about the world around them.</p>
<p>To cater to the diverse needs, interests, and learning goals of our students,
we incorporate Differentiated Instruction into our Science curriculum,
ensuring an inclusive and engaging learning experience for all. Teachers
adopt the 3Cs approach (Capture, Construct, and Consolidate) to design
meaningful lessons, alongside the CER (Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning)
framework, which equips students with effective answering techniques and
critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>Our programmes and activities are thoughtfully crafted to nurture students'
natural curiosity and develop essential 21st-century competencies, while
fostering an awareness of sustainability through level-wide Applied Learning
Programmes (ALP). Click <a href="https://www.chijourladyqueenofpeace.moe.edu.sg/olqp-experience/alp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
more information about our ALP Programme- STEM in Sustainability.</p>
<p>Students also have opportunities to extend their learning through enrichment
programmes such as the Science Olympiad and E2K, where they develop critical
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>For students requiring additional support, our after-school Science programme
reinforces foundational knowledge, building confidence and a strong grasp
of key concepts.</p>

### Student Leadership

#### Our Approach

Student leadership development at CHIJ OLQP seeks to develop leaders who: 

*   act with compassion; 
*   have moral courage; and
*   lead and serve with humility.

The school plans to use “The Leader in Me: 7 Habits of Happy Kids” leadership practice to develop in the students, leadership and 21CC. “The Leader in Me” is a comprehensive K-12 school improvement model that equips students with the essential leadership and life-readiness skills they need to thrive in the 21st Century, and enhances results for the school in the area of leadership, culture and academics.

The school’s 2-tier leadership development programme. It is designed to provide baseline leadership skills acquisition for all students, and also extends opportunities for students with high potential, to lead and serve the school through the various student groups. 

At the class level, “I Can Lead” aims to provide all students an opportunity to lead and serve their peers. The school creates platforms for students to hone their leadership skills, e.g. class monitor, group leaders and subject leaders. 

At the school level, “I Can Serve”, “The Leader in Me: 7 Habits of Happy Kids” extends the area of focus to ‘Create a Leadership Culture: Shared Leadership’. At this level, opportunities are provided for potential student leaders to serve in school-level leadership roles, e.g. prefects, CCA leaders and IJ Ambassadors. Student voice and collaborative leadership will lead to innovations in the school.

### Character Education

#### Our Approach

**Character Lives In My Behaviour**

Our CLIMB Programme adopts The Virtues Project as a CCE teaching and learning tool.  The Virtues Project is a positive and holistic programme used to bring out the best in children and adults (Linda Kavelin Popov, 2000). CLIMB focuses on a set of 52 virtues that are aligned to promote our school values.

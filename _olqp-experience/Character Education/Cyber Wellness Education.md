### Cyber Wellness Education

#### What is Cyber Wellness?

Cyber Wellness (CW) in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. In line with MOE’s curriculum, we aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to help students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.

#### MOE Cyber Wellness Framework

MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

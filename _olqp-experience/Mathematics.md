### Mathematics

#### Our Approach

To help our students build a strong foundation in the subject, we use the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach to deepen the understanding of abstract mathematical concepts through exploration and the use of teaching aids and pictures.  

Our students will also be engaged in investigative work, problem solving, math trails, games, puzzles and quizzes.   

In addition, to promote thinking and reasoning in the classroom, we adopt the Math AR³T strategy:

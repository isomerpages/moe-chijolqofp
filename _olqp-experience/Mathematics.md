<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>In CHIJ OLQP, we aim to make the learning of mathematics come&nbsp;<strong><em>A.L.I.V.E</em></strong>&nbsp;as
we build a strong foundation in the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Appreciation</strong>
</p>
<p>We cultivate the joy of learning mathematics and foster interest in the
subject through hands-on activities, games and puzzles.</p>
<p><strong>Link to Life</strong>
</p>
<p>We provide meaningful opportunities for our students to acquire mathematical
concepts and skills for everyday use by linking what they have learnt to
life.</p>
<p><strong>Inventive Thinking</strong>
</p>
<p>We develop our students into confident problem-solvers with thinking,
reasoning, communication and metacognitive skills.</p>
<p><strong>Virtues</strong>
</p>
<p>We inculcate important virtues, like cooperation, enthusiasm and perseverance
through collaborative work.</p>
<p><strong>Excellence</strong>
</p>
<p>We strive towards mastery of the subject through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>performance tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investigative work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>journaling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>math trails</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our programmes provide a holistic learning experience where our students
apply mathematical concepts and learn about local and global issues. The
Math Mania programme encourages and piques our studentsâ€™ interest by allowing
them to see the relevance of the subject in their daily experiences.</p>
<p>Enrichment programmes, such as Math Excellence 2000 (E2K) and Math Olympiad
Training, are conducted for students with the aptitude for the subject
and seek to further develop their mathematical reasoning skills.</p>
<p>In addition, the after-school support programme is conducted for students
who need additional help in reinforcing their foundation in mathematics.
Smaller group settings here provide for a more conducive learning environment.</p>

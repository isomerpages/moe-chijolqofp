<h3>Information Communication Technology</h3>
<p>At CHIJ OLQP, our Information Communication Technology (ICT) programme
supports the development of 21st Century Competencies and is aligned to
our school’s vision of developing “Enthusiastic Learners”. ICT is integrated
in the curriculum across all subjects to support authentic learning.</p>
<p>From Primary 1 to 6, teachers use various ICT tools, e.g. Google Workspace,
See Saw, Class Point, Padlet, Canva, Pixel Art, Garage Band, and the Singapore
Student Learning Space (SLS) to complement their classroom teaching. This
enriches students’ learning experiences through the design of meaningful
lessons for students to explore and work collaboratively, as well as facilitate
the development of students’ self-directed learning.</p>
<p>In addition, students acquire digital skills across four components in
the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/educational-technology-journey/edtech-masterplan/digital-literacy-and-technological-skills" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“Find, Think, Apply, Create” framework</a>&nbsp;
(See below) which woven into lessons of various subject disciplines at
different levels progressively.</p>

<p>To develop students’ computational thinking for problem solving, all Primary
1 to 6 students learn Coding in our school-based programme. These include
programming for Dash, Makey Makey, Sphero, etc. This helps to nurture their
critical thinking and creativity which are essential skills in the 21st
Century.</p>

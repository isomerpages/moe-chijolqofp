### PAL

The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is a recommendation by the 2009 Primary Education REview Implementation (PERI) Committee to provide greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for Primary 1 and 2 students.

  

PAL provides a broad exposure of experiences to our students in the four domains: Sport & Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. It offers a balance between the academic and non-academic areas in the school, and facilitates holistic and well-rounded development of the students.

  

In PAL, emphasis is placed on experiential learning. The hands-on experiences reinforce students’ learning, and allow them to explore, discover, generate further thinking and express their ideas. PAL provides an excellent platform for students to acquire social and emotional competencies and inculcate good values.

### Parent Support Group

##### Introduction

*   The PSG was initiated by the school in 2009.
*   Parents were keen to extend their experience and came forward to be involved in the holistic development of the pupils and were interested in contributing to the school initiatives and programmes. 

##### Role of PSG

*   The PSG serves as a vital link between the school, parents and the community. 
*   The council meets with the Principal and Vice-Principal regularly to discuss educational and student welfare concerns and improvement on school programmes.

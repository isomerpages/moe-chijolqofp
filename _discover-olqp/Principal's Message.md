<h3>Principal's Message</h3>
<p><strong>Welcome to CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace (OLQP)</strong>
</p>
<p>We are delighted that you are visiting our website and invite you to learn
more about who we are as a school community and how the IJ Dream is lived
out through our programmes, relationships and student experiences.</p>
<p>At OLQP, we believe that every child is gifted with God-given talents.
We are committed to providing a holistic education that extends beyond
academic achievement to the formation of character and a strong sense of
social responsibility. Grounded in strong fundamentals, we nurture our
girls to live out the spirit of the IJ Girl with courage, confidence and
compassion in all that they do.</p>
<p>We place a strong focus on deepening the quality of learning experiences
for our girls, nurturing confident learners who approach learning with
curiosity, perseverance and joy. Our OLQP girls are encouraged to be active
learners and critical thinkers who ask questions, make connections, reflect
on their learning and take ownership of their growth. Through intentional
teaching practices, our classrooms are safe and supportive spaces where
girls are encouraged to be confident and courageous in their thinking,
doing and speaking; to collaborate with others, share perspectives, and
recognise that effort, growth and courage to try are just as important
as outcomes.</p>
<p>At the heart of a CHIJ OLQP education is the cultivation of virtues and
the formation of leaders with humility who think deeply, communicate confidently
and act with compassion and kindness. Together with our dedicated teachers
and staff, we live out the IJ Dream by instilling the values of <strong>Truth, Justice, Freedom and Love</strong> in
our girls. Guided by these values and by the love and care of our teachers,
our girls are provided with diverse learning opportunities that empower
them to discover their strengths and to use their gifts and talents in
service to others, especially those who are disadvantaged. As they explore
their passions and make meaningful contributions to the school and wider
community, they develop a deep sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Through their six years at CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace, our girls will
grow in love for God, for themselves, and for others.</p>

<h3>Principal's Message</h3>
<p>Welcome to Our Lady Queen of Peace (OLQP) website. We hope you will enjoy
learning more about how our IJ dream is lived out through the various programmes
and student experiences.</p>
<p>At OLQP, we believe that every child is gifted with God-given talents,
and we are committed to provide a holistic education that extends beyond
academics to shape character and foster a strong sense of social responsibility.
Together with our teachers, we live out the IJ Dream and instill the values
of Truth, Justice, Freedom, and Love in our girls, guiding them to use
their gifts and talents in service to others—especially those who are disadvantaged.
We will integrate academic excellence with the cultivation of virtues to
equip our girls to be leaders of tomorrow— who are not only skilled and
think critically but are compassionate and act kindly. Our girls would
have many opportunities to engage in a variety of learning experiences
which empower them to discover their unique strengths, work collaboratively
with others, and embrace challenges. Through exploring their passions and
making meaningful contributions to the school and the wider community,
our students develop a deep sense of purpose. This equips them with the
dispositions, skills and moral compass needed to navigate the complexities
of tomorrow. Through these experiences, our girls grow to become an “Enthusiastic
Learner, Humble Leader and Gracious Lady”.</p>
<p>In 2025, we celebrate our school’s 70th anniversary - “Love &amp; Peace:
Our Heritage, Our Legacy”, a milestone that reflects decades of learning,
growth and excellence as a community. To commemorate this special occasion,
we have planned a variety of events and opportunities for everyone to come
together and celebrate. Highlights will include fundraising, a musical
showcasing the incredible talents of our girls, as well as a special Mass
to give thanks for our shared journey and blessings. We warmly invite all
parents to join us in these celebrations, as your support and participation
are integral to making this milestone a memorable and meaningful one. More
details will follow, and we look forward to celebrating with you!</p>

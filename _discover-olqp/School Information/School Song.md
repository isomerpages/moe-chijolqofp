**1st Verse**

Forward CHIJ forge a future bright <br>
Advancing our aims with zeal and might<br>
Guide us in our studies Oh Lord we pray<br>
Wisdom, Courage and Charity,
Strengthen in us each day.

**Chorus**<Br>
Solidly united in our motto sound<br>
Simple in virtue<br>
Strong in duty bound.

**2nd Verse**<br>
Loyal to our isle, we will ever be,<br>
Defending and serving our country,<br>
Noble in ambition, thought, word and deed,<br>
Rally round CHIJ we will strive to succeed.

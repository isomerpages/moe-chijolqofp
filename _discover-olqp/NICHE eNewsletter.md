<h3>NICHE e-Newsletter</h3>
<h4>Reflections from 2024</h4>
<p>The year 2024 was a special year in which the founding of the IJ Mission
in Singapore by the Infant Jesus (IJ) Sisters in 1854 was being commemorated
and celebrated for 170 years of blessings. The theme for the celebrations
was Hold On To Our IJ Dream. In CHIJ OLQP, through the e-newsletter, The
NICHE - Reflections from 2024, we would like to invite you to read about
the experiences of our students not only for the 170th Anniversary Celebrations,
but also for the whole year through. Enjoy!</p>

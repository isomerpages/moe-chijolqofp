### Programme for Active Learning (not done with gif)

PAL provides a broad exposure of experiences to our pupils in the 4 domains: Sport & Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. It offers a balance between the academic and non-academic areas in the school, and facilitates holistic and well-rounded development of the pupils. In PAL, emphasis is placed on experiential learning.  
  
The hands-on experiences reinforce pupils’ learning, and allow them to explore, discover, generate further thinking and express their ideas. As mentioned earlier, PAL provides an excellent platform for your child to acquire social and emotional competencies and inculcate good values.

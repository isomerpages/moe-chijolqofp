### Aesthetics

**CHIJ OLQP Arts Education** aims to develop all IJ girls to be confident advocates of the Arts and to demonstrate skills in both Visual and Performing Arts. Our art and music programmes nurture our IJ girls to reach their creative potential and become enthusiastic learners, humble leaders and gracious ladies.

Art is a language, an instrument of Knowledge, an instrument of communication.

### Information Communication Technology

#### Our Approach

To develop our students to be “Future-ready and Responsible Digital Learners”, the school’s ICT programme seeks to :

  

*   Integrate Baseline ICT Standards (New Media Literacies) into lessons to develop students’ disposition to be responsible digital learners
*   Leverage technology for active learning with the focus on :

*   assessment and feedback to develop students to be self-directed learners
*   learning and collaboration through online networks to develop students to be collaborative learners

*   Leverage technology to develop students’ computational thinking for problem solving


#### Programme Highlights 2022

From P1 to 6, teachers use the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning platform to complement their classroom teaching. This further enriches students’ learning experience through the design of meaningful lessons for students to explore and work collaboratively, as well as facilitate the development of students’ self-directed learning.

 In addition, students go through Digital Literacy lessons that are aligned to the 21st Century Competencies Framework, focusing on Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills.  This equip students with the knowledge and skills to search for and evaluate digital information, use information ethically to create or remix digital artefacts, exchange information and contribute productively in an online community. 

To develop students’ computational thinking for problem solving, all P1 to 6 students learn Coding in our school-based programme in the context of various subjects.  This helps to nurture their critical thinking and creativity which are essential skills in the 21st Century.

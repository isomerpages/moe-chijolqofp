##### 2\. Pedagogy– The use of Differentiated Instruction (DI)

The skills learnt in both reading and writing lessons are reinforced in differentiated activities for according to our students’ readiness, interests and learning profile (Tomlinson & Moon, 2013).  

  

  

##### 3\. School-based resources, print resources and integration of ICT

 

*   Explicit teaching of the language skills through customised worksheets       
*   Moo-O Reading Programme (P1 to P2)

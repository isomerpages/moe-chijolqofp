### Case Management Team

#### Our Approach

Our Case Management Team (CMT) aims to build a culture of care by enhancing teacher-student relationship and providing support for every IJ student. CMT plays a vital role in ensuring that our pupils with Special Learning Needs are promptly attended to through the various intervention strategies available.

There is a team of trained officers who dedicate their time to monitor closely the social emotional, behavioural and learning needs of our students. The AED (LBS), School Counsellor, Teacher Trained in Special Needs (TSN) and Teacher Counsellors work hand in hand with the schoolâ€™s Case Management Team to attend to the various special needs of our students in partnership with parents and MOE specialists and private psychologists when necessary.

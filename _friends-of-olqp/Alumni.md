<h5>CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace</h5>
<h6>Alumni Outreach</h6>
<p>CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace (CHIJ OLQP) has come a long way since it
was founded in 1955. From Bukit Timah Convent to CHIJ Bukit Timah and CHIJ
OLQP, strong bonds of friendship have been forged over the years, and many
have benefitted from a Christ-centred education in their formative years
at the school. It is heartening to know that graduates of CHIJ OLQP have
continued to impact the community at large. As such, in moving forward
to nurture a new generation of future-ready students from CHIJ OLQP, we
would like to reach out to past students of the school to join us on this
exciting journey ahead. To connect with us, we invite you to click on the

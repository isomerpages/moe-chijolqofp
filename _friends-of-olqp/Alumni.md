##### CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace  
###### Alumni Outreach

  

CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace (CHIJ OLQP) has come a long way since it was founded in 1955. From Bukit Timah Convent to CHIJ Bukit Timah and CHIJ OLQP, strong bonds of friendship have been forged over the years, and many have benefitted from a Christ-centred education in their formative years at the school. It is heartening to know that graduates of CHIJ OLQP have continued to impact the community at large. As such, in moving forward to nurture a new generation of future-ready students from CHIJ OLQP, we would like to reach out to past students of the school to join us on this exciting journey ahead.

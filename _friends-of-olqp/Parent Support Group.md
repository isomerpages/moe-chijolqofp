### Parent Support Group

#### Introduction

The Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed in 2009. Parents who were keen to contribute their time and expertise in support of the school initiatives and programmes came forward to be part of the holistic development of the students.

#### Role of PSG

The PSG serves as a vital link between the school, parents and community. The PSG council meets with the Principal and Vice-Principal regularly to plan for parent engagement, and parent-child activities.

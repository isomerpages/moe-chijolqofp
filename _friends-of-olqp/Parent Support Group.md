<h3>Parent Support Group</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed in 2009. Parents who were keen
to contribute their time and expertise in support of the school initiatives
and programmes came forward to be part of the holistic development of the
students.</p>
<h4>Role of PSG</h4>
<p>The PSG serves as a vital link between the school, parents and community.
The PSG council meets with the Principal and Vice-Principal regularly to
plan for parent engagement, and parent-child activities.</p>
<h4>Beyond the Council</h4>

parent representatives act as the key liaison for the Council to help relay
important information.</p>

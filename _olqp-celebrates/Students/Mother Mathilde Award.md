<h3>Mother Mathilde Award</h3>
<p>Rev. Mother Mathilde Raclot is the foundress of Convent of the Holy Infant
Jesus (CHIJ) in VIctoria Street. Being a woman with a vision and a deep
sense of mission, she was instrumental in bringing education to girls in
Asia and contributed to their growth and development in their God-given
talents. She was recognised by the government of Singapore in the Women's
Hall of Fame in 2014 for her contributions to education in Singapore. Today,
the eleven CHIJ schools in Singapore stand as a testament to Mother Mathilde's
work.</p>
<p>The Mother Mathilde Award is a pinnacle award given to a graduating student
who has fulfilled the holistic criteria of the award, namely Academic Excellence,
CCA Achievements, and Leadership and Service to the school and community.</p>
<p>The recipient of the Mother Mathilde Award should display the determination,
tenacity and courage that Mother Mathilde had in establishing the first
CHIJ school in Penang and Singapore. In emulating Mother Mathildeâ€™s leadership
qualities, the recipient should also exhibit the ability to optimise available
resources, and think creatively to meet challenges and rise above adversities.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the following outstanding recipients of the Mother
Mathilde Award.</p>

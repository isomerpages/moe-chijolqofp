### Sister Deirdre O’Loan Award

Born to an Irish family, Sr Deirdre O’Loan became a nun at the age of 17. Before coming to Singapore in 1974, she taught in Malaysia for several years. She began teaching General Paper in Catholic Junior College (CJC) upon its founding in 1975, and took on several leadership roles in her time at the school (Head of the English Language Department, Vice-Principal and Principal).

  

Upon completing her six-year stint as the principal of CJC, she was appointed Supervisor of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) schools overseeing 11 schools from 1994 to 2016. She worked closely with the principals, offering invaluable guidance, support and spiritual direction. Throughout her 22 years of service on the IJ Board of Management, she was known for her generosity, love, kindness, compassion and wisdom.

  

The Sr Deirdre O’Loan Award is a special award presented by the IJ Board of Management in memory of Sr Deirdre O’Loan who passed away in 2016. This is in honour of the well-loved educator who embodied the CHIJ motto of being “Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty”, and worked tirelessly for others throughout her life.

  

The Sr Deidre O’Loan Award recipient has excelled in demonstrating a pioneering spirit, a persevering attitude, resilience and resourcefulness. Anchored in faith, she is a role model in living out these values at the school and community level. The award acclaims the recipient’s compassionate, selfless and collaborative service to others and the community.

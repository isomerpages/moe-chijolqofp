### CCE Role Models

Our CLIMB Programme adopts The Virtues Project as a CCE teaching and learning tool. The Virtues Project is a positive and holistic programme used to bring out the best in children and adults. CLIMB focuses on a set of 52 virtues that are aligned to promote our school values.

  

In line with the school’s vision of developing our girls into an “Enthusiastic Learners, Humble Leaders and Gracious Ladies”, the CCE Role Model award serves as a recognition platform to acknowledge our students who have demonstrated the school values of Truth, Justice, Freedom and Love as well as the virtues in their daily lives. The awards are presented termly.

  

In Term 1, the focus was on the school value of Love. It is heartening to see our students desiring to be organised and considerate! Driven by the school value of Love, they exhibited the virtues of tact and gentleness to show consideration towards others. They also led by example in keeping their learning environment spick and span, a demonstration of their love for the environment. We are proud to nominate them as our Term 1 CCE Role Models!

Way to go, our CCE Role Models!

The virtue of determination helps channel your focus and efforts on a task. With these virtues, it leads us to achieve what we want and we are honour to nominate the following students as our Term 4 CCE Role Models!
